# Excel Data Transformation & Cleaning
Welcome to Data Transformation and Analysis project! In this repository, I've meticulously transformed unstructured data using Power Query within Microsoft Excel. The dataset includes information on ship modes, segments, and order dates, with corresponding sales values.
<h2>Key Transformations:</h2>
<strong>Power Query Workflow:</strong>

<strong>Data Transformation:</strong> Employed a series of Power Query steps to structure and clean the unorganized  data.

<strong>Column Selection:</strong> Chose relevant columns to focus on ship modes, segments, order dates, and corresponding sales values.

<strong>Custom Columns:</strong> Applied custom columns to capture specific calculations or information needed for analysis.

<strong>Appends and Merges:</strong> Combined multiple data sources through appends and merges for a comprehensive dataset.

<strong>Column Renaming:</strong> Ensured clarity and consistency by renaming columns for improved readability.


<h2>Structured Data:</h2>
The resulting structured data provides a clear view of sales figures categorized by ship modes, segments, and order dates. This organized dataset serves as a foundation for insightful analysis and visualization.
